Stealth photo taker adroid app that sends the image to a remote java server.

Only uploads first image taken, TRICK: take image, send  it, delete image, then take a new one you can send.

Ip must be yor public ip and open port is 80 on my computer.

The image then needs to be repaired on https://jpg.repair/
